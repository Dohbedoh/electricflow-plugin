  <p>Throw exception if the CloudBees CD Runtime was finished with warning or error.
    Other steps and stages will not be executed unless the exception is handled.</p>

  <p>This allows flexible negative pipeline flow when using the <i>warnError</i> and <i>unstable</i>
    steps.
    In Freestyle projects PBAs are failing separately so this will not affect it's execution.</p>
